Structured comment name	Definition	Expected value	Value syntax	Example	Section	Preferred unit	MIXS ID	Item	Occurrence
samp_name	A local identifier or name that for the material sample used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. It can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples.
