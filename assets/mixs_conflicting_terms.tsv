The method that was used for the enumeration (e.g. qPCR, atp, mpn, etc.) should also be provided. (example: total prokaryotes;3.5e7 cells per ml;qPCR).
MIXS:0000332	soil_type	soil type	ENVO_00001998	{termLabel} {[termID]}	m		Description of the soil type or classification. This field accepts terms under soil (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998). Multiple terms can be separated by pipes.
MIXS:0000183	salinity	salinity	measurement value	{float} {unit}	1	practical salinity unit, percentage	The total concentration of all dissolved salts in a liquid or solid sample. While salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult and time consuming. More often, it is instead derived from the conductivity measurement. This is known as practical salinity. These derivations compare the specific conductance of the sample to a salinity standard such as seawater.
MIXS:0000018	depth	depth	measurement value	{float} {unit}	1	meter	The vertical distance below local surface, e.g. for sediment or soil samples depth is measured from sediment or soil surface, respectively. Depth can be reported as an interval for subsurface samples.

The method that was used for the enumeration (e.g. qPCR, atp, mpn, etc.) should also be provided. (example: total prokaryotes;3.5e7 cells per ml;qPCR).
MIXS:0001107	samp_name	sample name 	text	{text}	1		A local identifier or name that for the material sample used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. It can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. It can have any format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within your lab, and as informative as possible. INSDC requires every sample name from a single Submitter to be unique. Use of a globally unique identifier for the field source_mat_id is recommended in addition to sample_name.
